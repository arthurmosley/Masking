Keep it simple!

do it in Python3

Feel free to use any 3rd part library to help you.
I'm supplying you a simple Tree class in python.

Job is,

inspect a JPEG file, decompose the file into a tree (i.e. a directed graph
with a single root node) that describes each significant chunk of the file in
terms of a tuple.

(start, length, type)

Now we need to digress into what 'type' means.

type should be one of 'BASIC', 'LSBStream', 'MSBStream'
BASIC means that start and length are in BYTES, where 0 means the beginning of the file

LSBStream means this fragment's start and length describe a contiguous
sequence of bits in little endian order

MSBStream says that fragment's start and length describe a contiguous sequence
of bits in big endian order:

if type is LSBStream, you MUST treat "bit 0" as the LEAST significant bit of the "word"
if type is MSBStream, you MUST treat "bit 0" as the MOST significant bit of the "word"
where "word" is a unit of 1,2,4, or 8 bytes
THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM HOW Python (and C) refer to bit positioning!
Python and C/C++ always treat "bit 0" of a "word" as the least significant
bit.

Why do I do this? This is so that regardless of whether an object is
originally a big endian or little endian format, the offset and length will
always refer to the EXACT same location in the object:

Take a look at below. It is an 8 byte unit. Row X shows the byte positions,
and Rows A and B list the bit positions (in base 16).
Row C shows the positions of the most and least significant bits of each word.
Remember -- bits are not machine accessible. Row C also shows the position
of a bit marked "*". This marked bit shows in which word the bit is located.


  Bit Ordering and Endianness --
  "M" means most significant, "L" means least significant

  LE chunksize=1byte
  LSB to MSB
X:0       :1       :2       :3       :4       :5       :6       :7       :
A:00000000:00000000:11111111:11111111:22222222:22222222:33333333:33333333
B:01234567:89abcdef:01234567:89abcdef:01234567:89abcdef:01234567:89abcdef:
C:L      M:L      M:L  *   M:L      M:L      M:L      M:L      M:L      M:


  In the above example, the word is 1 byte. Each byte is composed of 8 bits.
  The row marked X shows the BYTE offset. Combine the digit in row A with the
  digit in row B to get the bit position. In this example, bit bit position
  marked with "*" is read 0x13 or 19 decimal.
  This bit is located inside byte 2.

  Now, lets move to word size of 2 bytes (i.e. C "short"). We're still keeping
  bit 0 as the least significant bit of the word.

  LE chunksize=2byte
  LSB to MSB
Y:0               :1                :2              :3               :4
X:0      :1       :2       :3       :4      :5      :6      :7       :
A:0000000000000000:1111111111111111:2222222222222222:3333333333333333
B:0123456789abcdef:0123456789abcdef:0123456789abcdef:0123456789abcdef:
C:L              M:L    *         M:L              M:L              M:

  In the above example, wordsize is 2 bytes (a "C" short). Row Y describes the
  offset in "shorts" and row X still descbribes the byte offset. Even here,
  the "*" bit is bit 19 (0x13) (or 0d19 -- 0d is nonstandard marker for
  "decimal" or base 10 notation). It is still located within byte 2, but its
  located in word 1.

  Now, lets assume that we are examining a file that comes from a big endian
  machine, and we are still using bytes as the "word". In the example below,
  we're still treating bit 0 as the least significant bit.

  BE chunksize=1byte,Bit0=LSB
  LSB to MSB
X:0       :1       :2       :3       :4       :5       :6       :7       :
A:00000000:00000000:11111111:11111111:22222222:22222222:33333333:33333333
B:01234567:89abcdef:01234567:89abcdef:01234567:89abcdef:01234567:89abcdef:
C:L      M:L      M:L  *   M:L      M:L      M:L      M:L      M:L      M:


  As you can see, in this example, bit 19 (0x13) still describes the exact same
  bit as in the prior two LSB cases.

  So what happens if we move up to a larger word size?

  BE chunksize=2byte,Bit0=LSB
  LSB to MSB
Y:0                :1                :2             :3               :4
X:0       :1       :2       :3       :4      :5     :6      :7       :
A:0000000000000000:1111111111111111:2222222222222222:3333333333333333
B:89abcdef01234567:89abcdef01234567:89abcdef01234567:89abcdef01234567
C:       ML       :       ML  *    :       ML       :       ML       :

The above example shows how C (and all other programming languages) treat
bits. Bit 0 is seen as the least significant bit. In other words, the most
significant bit of each word is now located at a different physical BYTE.
In other words, bit 19 (0x13) now refers to a bit in BYTE 3!
Take a look at the bit positions of the bits marked "M". They are at different
places than the LSB cases.

So now, lets take a look at the same chunk from a big endian machine, except
now we artificially change the meaning of bit 0 to mean Most significant.

  BE chunksize=1byte,Bit0=MSB
  MSB to LSB
X:0       :1       :2       :3       :4       :5       :6       :7       :
A:00000000:00000000:11111111:11111111:22222222:22222222:33333333:33333333
B:01234567:89abcdef:01234567:89abcdef:01234567:89abcdef:01234567:89abcdef:
C:M      L:M      L:M  *   L:M      L:M      L:M      L:M      L:M      L:

In the above example, bit 19 (0x13) STILL refers to the exact same bit as in
the LSB case. So now lets take a look at when we use a word size greater than
1 byte.

  BE chunksize=2byte,Bit0=MSB
  MSB to LSB
Y:0                :1                :2             :3               :4
X:0       :1       :2       :3       :4      :5     :6      :7       :
A:0000000000000000:1111111111111111:2222222222222222:3333333333333333
B:0123456789abcdef:0123456789abcdef:0123456789abcdef:0123456789abcdef:
C:M              L:M  *           L:M              L:M              L:

  As long as the endianness is LE, the bit positions refer to the same
  bit in the same byte. For BE, bit 0 HAS to be the MSB for the byte-bit
  offset to be the same across chunk sizes. This way, the chunk size
  need not be recorded.

  This is the best way to specify bit fields that is architecturally neutral.
  You won't need to worry about supporting 'MSBStream' case. Since the PC is
  little endian, you will only need to worry about 'BASIC' (where the offset
  and length are in bytes) or 'LSBStream' where the offset and length describe
  the bit position where bit 0 is the least significant bit.

  Remember that bits are not directly addressable, only bytes are.
  So the notion of how to describe a bit field is purely for our
  convenience. So a bit position is translated into (word offset, bit offset
  in word). To be more efficient, if we adapt the bit numbering scheme
  where for little endian machines, bit 0 is the LSB, and for big endian
  machines, bit 0 is the MSB, the same bit position number can be used to
  refer to the exact same BYTE and bit offset regardless of where that chunk
  comes from.


Take a look at the simple Tree.py and Unit.py
It shows you how to use the very simple DebugHelper class to selectively print
debugging statements, as well as how to use the FragmentInfo class.

Coding style requirement here is use Python indent of TWO spaces, and use UNIX line endings.

This is not a hw assignment. Therefore, use whatever other python3 packages
you wish. Steal liberally. (Just keep track of where you get stuff from, for
legal purposes)

DGA.py contains an implementation of depth first search and Strongly connected
components algorithms. You probably won't need it. It also shows more examples
of how to use DebugHelper to selectively print debugging statements.

Only requirement is that you output a tree of FragmentInfo's (decorated
however you see fit) for every chunk of a JPEG file.

READ THROUGH ALL THE FILES HERE CAREFULLY!
You should try very hard to come up with a Tree form, such that PARENT nodes
"cover" the child nodes.

For example, if a struct 48 byte long struct in a file starts at byte 10
then the tree for that region should start off with:

+ (10, 48, BASIC)
|
+ 

The BASIC marker means that the offsets in this fragment are in bytes.

Lets assume the first 10 BITS for this struct is a 10 bit number, then the
tree might be

+ (10, 48, BASIC)
|
+-- (80, 10, LSBStream)

i.e. bit 80 points to the LSB bit at the beginning of
the struct. The LSBStream marker means that the offset and length are in
BITS. Note that this new child node overlaps the parent, because bits 80
through 90 overlap bytes 10 through 58

Let's assume that the next 6 bits are not used
Let's assume tht the third byte of this struct presents some kind of numeric
code, which is 8 bits long

+ (10, 48, BASIC)
|
+-- (80, 10, LSBStream)
+-- (96, 8, LSBStream)

Let's assume that the bytes 4 through 10 in the struct is a substructure,
then the tree will look like the following.

+ (10, 48, BASIC)
|
+-- (80, 10, LSBStream)
+-- (96, 8, LSBStream)
+-- (14, 6, BASIC)

Lets assme that this new struct is split into 3 2-byte fields
+ (10, 48, BASIC)
|
+-- (80, 10, LSBStream)
+-- (96, 8, LSBStream)
+-+ (14, 6, BASIC)
  +--- (14, 2, BASIC)
  +--- (16, 2, BASIC)
  +--- (18, 2, BASIC)


You will need to write an API that uses a FragmentInfo to query a file (or an
in-memory representation of a file) that returns the actual byte sequence that
FragmentInfo refers to. Just remember that since bits are not directly
addressable, you'll need to convert bit offsets to byte offset + LSB offset in
the byte in order for you to get at the actual bits in question.

The FragmentInfo currently just holds the offset, length, and type.
The api should set the 'payload' field of FragmentInfo with the adjusted raw
byte sequence from the file that correspond to the location specified by the
fragment. If the offset and or length is not divisible by 8, you should adjust
the bytes so that the first byte and first bit of the payload correspond to
the first bit of the region.

In other words

  LE chunksize=2byte
  LSB to MSB
Y:0               :1                :2              :3               :4
X:0      :1       :2       :3       :4      :5      :6      :7       :
A:0000000000000000:1111111111111111:2222222222222222:3333333333333333
B:0123456789abcdef:0123456789abcdef:0123456789abcdef:0123456789abcdef:
C:L              M:L              M:L              M:L              M:
V:0000011111100000:0101000111011011:1111000011110000:1100110011001100:
P:                :   ***********  :

Let's assume that a FragmentInfo specifies (19, 11, LSBStream). The bits in
question are marked with '*" in row P.

If you were to grab the this Fragment naively, the bits that you grab
would cover the 2 byte region (2,2, Basic), with the bits 01010001:11011011
resulting in the byte value (138 (0x8a) (+ 2 8 128)), and (219 0xdb (+ 1 2 8 16 64 128))
Note that bit on the RIGHT are more significant.
the first byte 01010001  decodes to 2 + 8 + 128 for the 1 bits from left to
right and the second byte 11011011 decodes to 1 + 2 + 8 + 16 + 64 + 128
Unfortunately, this 2 byte sequence has bits that we are not interested in.
So the solution is to adjust the payload to throw away bits that we do not want.

So the bits that we want are:
01010001:11011011
   10001:110110

When the sequence ???10001:110110??? is shifted to the left by 3, the resulting
value in the payload is:
10001110:110*****  where the '*' are simply set to 0

In this case the two byte sequence that covers the 11 bit field is
(113 0x71 (+ 1 16 32 64)) and (3, 0x3 (+ 1 2)).
